### Instructor

* The following statements were taken from [Advanced JS](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus):
Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

### Reminders
* Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
* Don't forget to check what kind of open source license as source code have. You may want to visit [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) for more information.
